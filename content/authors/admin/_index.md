Guochun Yang is currently a postdoctoral research scholar at University of Iowa. He got his B.M. from Wuhan University and his Ph.D. from Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.  research interests lie at the intersection of cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and computational modeling. Specifically, 
•	He have been focused on the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying cognitive control, with a particular emphasis on how cognitive control are flexibly executed in different scenarios.
•	He have extensive experience in designing cognitive paradigms, collecting data from different modalities (e.g., behavior, EEG and fMRI), and applying advanced data analytic methods (e.g., decoding, computational modeling). 
•	His work has been published in a list of peer-reviewed journals such as Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Review, Journal of Neuroscience, etc., and has been recognized with several awards and grants.
